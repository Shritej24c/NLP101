      "    distorted representation of the data. Much like the choice of bin width in a\n",
      "    histogram, an over-smoothed curve can erase true features of a\n",
      "    distribution, while an under-smoothed curve can create false features out of\n",
      "    random variability. The rule-of-thumb that sets the default bandwidth works\n",
      "    best when the true distribution is smooth, unimodal, and roughly bell-shaped.\n",
      "    It is always a good idea to check the default behavior by using ``bw_adjust``\n",
      "    to increase or decrease the amount of smoothing.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Because the smoothing algorithm uses a Gaussian kernel, the estimated density\n",
      "    curve can extend to values that do not make sense for a particular dataset.\n",
      "    For example, the curve may be drawn over negative values when smoothing data\n",
      "    that are naturally positive. The ``cut`` and ``clip`` parameters can be used\n",
      "    to control the extent of the curve, but datasets that have many observations\n",
      "    close to a natural boundary may be better served by a different visualization\n",
      "    method.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Similar considerations apply when a dataset is naturally discrete or \"spiky\"\n",
      "    (containing many repeated observations of the same value). Kernel density\n",
      "    estimation will always produce a smooth curve, which would be misleading\n",
