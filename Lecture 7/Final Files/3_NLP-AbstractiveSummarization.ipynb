It consists of a collection of dialogues along with brief summaries. Most of the datasets for text summarization available before SAMSum were focused on summarizing articles, papers, or other long-form content. However, the SAMSum dataset targets the summarization of dialogues, which has its own unique challenges and characteristics.\n","\n","Here are some key points about the SAMSum dataset:\n","\n","1. **Dialogues Data**: The dataset consists of dialogues and their corresponding abstractive summaries. This is in contrast to most other summarization datasets, which contain news articles or scientific papers.\n","  \n","2. **Size**: The SAMSum corpus contains thousands of dialogues, making it a substantial resource for training and testing summarization models on conversational data.\n","  \n"," 4. **Source**: The dialogues in SAMSum are based on real-life conversations but have been anonymized and altered to protect privacy and for clarity.\n","  \n","5. **Application**: In an enterprise setting, these dialogues might represent the interactions between a customer and the support center. Therefore, generating accurate summaries can help improve customer service and detect common patterns among customer requests. It's also useful for developing models that can generate summaries for chatbot conversations and other conversational platforms.\n","  \n","6. **Format**: Each dialogue in the dataset is presented as a series of turns between two participants, followed by a human-written summary capturing the main points of the conversation.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b906904c-8f24-4de0-8e07-720863e8cd99","metadata":{"id":"b906904c-8f24-4de0-8e07-720863e8cd99"},"source":["## <font color = 'pickle'> **Load Data set**\n","    \n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"yC6lJrxYvxeF","metadata":{"id":"yC6lJrxYvxeF"},"outputs":[],"source":["from datasets import load_dataset, DatasetDict\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"1JpTLLoCvuAY","metadata":{"id":"1JpTLLoCvuAY"},"outputs":[],"source":["samsum_dataset = load_dataset(\"samsum\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"MluH2KHxHfF0","metadata":{"id":"MluH2KHxHfF0"},"source":["## <font color = 'pickle'> **Understanding your data**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"13c259d6-3936-47d7-aae4-467cf479368d","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-23T23:13:19.870767Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-23T23:13:19.870527Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-23T23:13:20.007104Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-23T23:13:20.006616Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-23T23:13:19.870741Z"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1075,"status":"ok","timestamp":1692164678853,"user":{"displayName":"Harpreet SIngh","userId":"15106381096049879330"},"user_tz":300},"id":"13c259d6-3936-47d7-aae4-467cf479368d","outputId":"1f6002a6-077a-4a1b-f040-83c4e68f5d74","tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["DatasetDict({\n","    train: Dataset({\n","        features: ['id', 'dialogue', 'summary'],\n","        num_rows: 14732\n","    })\n","    test: Dataset({\n","        features: ['id', 'dialogue', 'summary'],\n","        num_rows: 819\n","    })\n","    validation: Dataset({\n","        features: ['id', 'dialogue', 'summary'],\n","        num_rows: 818\n","    })\n","})\n"]}],"source":["print(samsum_dataset)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"G8mgUnP9fS7i","metadata":{"id":"G8mgUnP9fS7i"},"source":["## <font color = 'pickle'> **Understanding the datatype of columns**\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"wq_SXtXzeXWg","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":292,"status":"ok","timestamp":1692094170000,"user":{"displayName":"Shaannoor Mann","userId":"02520257695567980696"},"user_tz":300},"id":"wq_SXtXzeXWg","outputId":"5f260056-1657-4c44-b26d-872df15f1f5a"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["{'id': Value(dtype='string', id=None),\n"," 'dialogue': Value(dtype='string', id=None),\n"," 'summary': Value(dtype='string', id=None)}"]},"execution_count":16,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["samsum_dataset[\"train\"].features\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"Qcr2Oj01-No5","metadata":{"id":"Qcr2Oj01-No5"},"source":[" Code Explanation:\n","\n"," The code samsum_dataset['train'].features returns a description of the features (columns and their data types) present in the training split of the samsum dataset."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"DU8B80kvfudo","metadata":{"id":"DU8B80kvfudo"},"source":["All the columns are of string data type.
